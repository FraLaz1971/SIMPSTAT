SIMPSTAT is a small educational project
written in standard BASIC 
that perform and prints on the terminal
simple statistics operations
on a data set contained in a BASIC source file.
The main program is COMPSTAT.BAS, it
should be ran in a BASIC interpreter.

A source file SSTAT.BAS is combined appending
the lines of BASIC source file STATDATA.BAS 
that contains the data to be processed,
included as first data, the size of array
to be processed as only metadata value.

This has been tested to work correctly in
pcbasic (gwbasic), qb64 (qbasic) and bwbasic.

Running the source file bCS.BAS the same will
be performed on brandy (BBC BASIC) environment.
A different program has been developed because
file I/O instructions are incompatible between
the 2 groups of BASIC dialects.
